You can add a hook or a description of your blog here.

Manage general information from `_config.yml`, such as name, contacts, social links, number of posts to be displayed in the homepage (the grid down here).

Access to your whole posts archive by creating a page with the `layout: archive` and a page with the list of your posts' categories with the `layout: categories`. For installation and usage guide see [Lilium on GitHub](https://github.com/szuliani/lilium-jekyll-theme).
