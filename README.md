# Lilium

Welcome to **Lilium theme** for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). This template is designed for a smooth garden-like blogging experience 🌱

> [!WARNING]
> Although this used to be a full digital garden theme, now I reduced the functions due developing and maintaining difficulties. Graphs are no longer supported but you can use it for digital gardening anyway and you can add plugins for semantic blogging.

🇬🇧 Also, for now Lilium theme is only available in english.

## Installation

Add this line to your Jekyll site's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'lilium-jekyll-theme', '~> 0.2.0'
```

And add this line to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml`:

```yaml
theme: lilium-jekyll-theme
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

## Usage

Manage general information from `_config.yml`, such as name, contacts, social links, number of posts to be displayed in the homepage (the grid down here).

Default is `layout: page` for pages and `layout: post` for posts. Access to your whole posts archive by creating a page with the `layout: archive` and a page with the list of your posts' categories with the `layout: categories`.
